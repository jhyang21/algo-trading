**Bitcoin Trading Algorithm Combining Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)**
This project implements an algorithmic trading strategy using an ANN to produce the drift parameter for a DDM. The ANN is trained on historical market data to predict the drift rate, which is then used in the DDM to make trading decisions. The strategy is backtested against historical data to evaluate its performance.
